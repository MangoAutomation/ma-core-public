This directory contains scripts that act as extensions to the generic MA 
scripts. Extension scripts can be enabled by creating a symbolic link in the 
ext-enabled dir to the scripts in this dir. The links can be named such that
the extensions run in a certain order.

Extensions are run in the source shell, and so can define or override variables
defined in other scripts. Extensions are provided a parameter in their call 
that determines the current activity. These are init, start, restart, and stop.
