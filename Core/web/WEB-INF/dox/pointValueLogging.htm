<p>Mango supports four types of point value logging</p>

<p>
  <b>When point value changes</b> is the default logging setting. The point value and its time of occurrence is written 
  to the database only if the value of the point actually changes. This setting provides the best compromise of quality 
  of historical information vs storage space efficiency. For Numeric points, a <b>Tolerance</b>, or "deadband", can 
  also be provided; the value will be logged if the absolute value of the difference between the present value and the 
  previous value equals or exceeds the given tolerance.
</p>

<p>
  The <b>All data</b> setting causes every point update to be saved to the database. Only use this setting if knowledge 
  of every update is definitely required since a great deal of data can be accumulated very quickly, which over time 
  can cause serious performance degradation.
</p>

<p>
  The <b>Do not log</b> setting prevents any historical data for the point from being stored in the database. Please 
  note that chart renderers typically require logged data to function properly. Only use "Do not log" when certain that 
  the value history is not needed.
</p>

<p>
  The <b>Interval</b> setting allows the collection of data via the data source to be separated from its logging. Use
  this when the data source is collecting data very frequently (say, for event detector purposes), but all the data is
  not required to be logged. The <b>Value type</b> may be chosen with this option. "Instant" means that the current
  value of the point is logged, while the other options will cause a statistic of the points values over the period to
  be logged.
</p>
<p>
  For <b>Average</b> value type interval logging the option to specify a sample window size is provided.  By checking 
  <b>Override interval logging sample window</b> the option 
  to input a custom sample window size is provided.  The <b>Sample window size</b> represents the number of previous point 
  samples that will be used to compute the average.  Each sample is obtained at the Data source poll period, so for example 
  a poll period of 5 seconds and 10 samples would require 50 seconds of samples to be used in the Average.  It should also be 
  noted that the mid-point time for the window is used as the sample time of the average that is stored in Mango.  Also, when 
  overriding the sample window no average is computed until the window is full.  So in the above example you will see a 25 second 
  delay at the start of your data (50 seconds of samples and the first sample time is the center of the window).
</p>

<p>
  The <b>When point timestamp changes</b> setting. This is similar in behaviour to the on value change setting, but
  the timestamp of the sample is compared instead of the value.
</p>

<p>
  Value discarding can be set to deal with equipment that can occasionally send errant values. When <b>Discard extreme 
  values</b> is set, the <b>Discard low limit</b> and <b>Discard high limit</b> text boxes are enabled. Values less
  than the low limit or higher than the high limit are thereafter discarded. Any existing values already stored will
  remain.
</p>

<p>
  The <b>Purge</b> settings determine how long a point's historical values should be kept in the database. Values can 
  be practically kept as long as necessary, but note that performance degradation may occur if the history for a given 
  point becomes too large. (Actually performance of the system depends strongly upon the host hardware.) The purge 
  process runs automatically every morning at 3:05am local time.
</p>

<p>
  If <b>Override data source purge settings</b> is checked, the time period shown will be used. Otherwise, the purge
  time period of the data source will be used.
</p>

<p>
  The <b>Default cache size</b> is the number of values that will be stored in memory. This setting is especially 
  important when a logging method other than "All data" is used. Values that are stored in memory are collated with 
  those stored to the database when necessary. Setting this value very high may improve system performance (since it 
  may prevent a database query), but caution should be used since memory is consumed by the cache, and out of memory
  conditions may occur. The "Reset cache" is normally not necessary to use, but may be convenient in cases where manual 
  deletes of point values have been done (say, using the SQL functionality).
