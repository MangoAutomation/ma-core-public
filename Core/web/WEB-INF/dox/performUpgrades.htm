<p>Mango provides tools to download and update your Mango Automation instance. Our server will provide you
a list of the latest modules, and this manifest is presented for your review before downloading. You are also presented with 
the option to perform a system backup automatically as part of the upgrading process. This automatic backup will save your H2 database
and your JSON configuration to your specified directory. These locations are configurable on the systems settings page sections <b>Configuration 
Backup Settings</b> and <b>H2 Database Backup Settings</b>. A SQL dump is not yet implemented for MySQL, so be sure to backup your MySQL database!</p>

<p>If <b>Restart after download</b> is checked in the Advanced Options, which it is by default, your instance of Mango will restart after it finishes 
the downloads to finish the upgrade process.</p>
