<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  This facility can be used to export and import various aspects of your Mango configuration. This ability provides 
  several benefits:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt><b>Backup and restore</b></dt>
  <dd>
    Export your entire configuration, and save the resulting text in a safe place. If your Mango instance suffers a 
    catastrophic failure you can create a new instance and import your configuration file to quickly recreate the
    instance.
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Create and maintain identical instances</b></dt>
  <dd>
    Export the elements of your configuration that are common across all of your instances. To create a new similar
    instance, import the common configuration and then tweak as necessary. To make changes across all of your instances
    simply change the configuration file and import into all of you instances. Or, change one instance, export, and 
    then import that result into all of the other instances.
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Maintain large, complex configurations</b></dt>
  <dd>
    Although widely praised for its aesthetics and ease of use, the Mango user interface was not designed to handle
    extremely large and complex configurations. In such a case the export files can be used as an alternate means to
    manage your configuration. Make your changes directly in the configuration file, and then import into your 
    instances.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h1>Exporting</h1>
<p>
  You can choose to export your entire configuration by checking each of the options within <b>Select what you would 
  like to export</b>. Or, you can choose to only export portions as required. The result of the export operation will
  be displayed in the <b>Data</b> text area, from which you can copy and paste elsewhere, or make direct changes.
</p>

<h1>Importing</h1>
<p>
  Similar to how users can select what to export, you may also choose to import only a small portion of your entire
  configuration. For the most part any information that is excluded from your import file will remain unchanged. For 
  example, if your import data does not include the "eventDetectors" attribute within a data point, that point's event
  detectors list will remain unchanged. However, if the attribute is included the list will be replaced with the 
  contents of the attribute.
</p>
<p>
  In general, any Mango object that has a unique identifier is capable of being created and updated&mdash;but not 
  deleted. Such objects that are supported by this facility will have and <b>Export Id, or XID</b>. This attribute is
  specifically designated to provide unique identification of objects between Mango instances. This is similar to a
  database-generated primary key, but primary keys cannot be made to match over multiple Mango instances. When an 
  object&mdash;such as a data source&mdash;is created using the Mango interface it is automatically given an 
  instance-unique XID. Although it cannot be guaranteed to be unique across all of your Mango instances, there is a 
  high probability that it will be. You may change the XID to any 50 character value you like as long as the value is 
  still unique for that object type within the instance.
</p>
<p>
  Imports may fail for multiple reasons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If the format of you JSON is incorrect, the entire import will fail and you will be provided with an error message
    describing the cause and the location of the likely problem within your data.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a required data element is missing or invalid, the import of the associated object will fail, but other objects 
    may still import successfully. You will be provided with a list of all objects whose import succeeded, and a list
    of descriptive errors messages for failures.
  </li>
</ul>

<h1>Data Format</h1>

<h2>Import/Export JSON</h2>
<p>
  The import/export facility uses the JSON format (see <a href="http://www.json.org/" target="_blank">http://www.json.org/</a>
  for more information) as the data format for configuration files. JSON is a very similar data format that is easy to 
  understand and use. (For users familiar with Javascript JSON will be immediately familiar.) JSON was chosen over the
  more common XML format because it provides better mapping to the actual Mango object structure, and is also more
  compact.
</p>
<p>
  Mango will automatically create "pretty" JSON export files, i.e. it will format the output with appropriate line 
  breaks and indenting. The amount of indenting can be controlled with the <b>Indent level</b> attribute.
</p>
<h2>Import Data Points from CSV</h2>
<p>Data Points can be imported from a CSV file.  The format is very specific to each Data Source.  It is recommended to export a point from the data source page
for your type of point, modify the file and then upload it here.</p>
<p><b>Important Notes:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Column order is important.</li>
  <li>Header names must not be modified.</li>
  <li>Template XIDs must be used as not all properties are available within the CSV.</li>
  <li>The data source type for all points must match, ie. no mixing points from multiple types of data sources in one upload.</li>
  <li>New points can be created.</li>
</ul>
