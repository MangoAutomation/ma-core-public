  This page provides controls for editing the properties of a point. The <img src="images/icon_comp.png"/> icon 
  provides a link to the read-only point details page; it is visible only for points that have been saved.
</p>
<p>
  The data source name is provided for reference. The <img src="images/icon_ds_edit.png"/> icon is a link to the data 
  source editing page where the value locator configuration can be found, and is provided as a convenience.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Point name</b> is required, and can be any text value. This name will be used as the visual identifier for the 
  point throughout the system.
</p>
<p>
  Often, the point name is supplemented with the <b>Device name</b> when it is shown in lists with other points. The
  two together are referred to as the "extended point name". The device name is initially defaulted to the data source
  name, but can be changed. The two together allow a point to be uniquely identified in an instance, especially in cases
  where there are multiple points with the same name.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Engineering units</b> can be provided for a point. This is used for human reference only.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Chart colour</b> is the default colour of the point's line in images charts of multiple points. Colour values 
  can be an HTML-style hex, or any colour name in the HTML specification. For example, "#2468AC", "red", and 
  "dodgerblue" are all valid values.
