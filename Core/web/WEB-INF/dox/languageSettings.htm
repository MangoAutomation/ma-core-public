  Use the <b>System language</b> setting to change the language the system will use in cases where the language is
  otherwise unknown. For example, reports and emails are either not associated with a specific user, or are associated
  with multiple users. The system language will be used in these situations.

  Note that Mango uses many toolkits and such that are not i18n, and so you may still receive rare messages that appear
  in English only.

<h1>Creating a new translation</h1>
<p>
  Mango is a fully multilingual-capable system. If Mango does not ship with a desired language, it is easy to make a
  translation file so that at least your instance "speaks" the language you need. To add a language, first edit the 
  "WEB-INF/classes/i18n.properties" file by adding the information about the language you wish to add. The format for 
  data is "&lt;language code&gt;=&lt;language name&gt;", where "language code" is the ISO 639-1 code for the language,
  and "language name" is the name of the language as it is known in its own language. This will add the language to the
  list of known languages within the system 
</p>

<p>
  Now, a list of literal translations must be prepared. Create a new file in the "WEB-INF/classes/" directory called
  "messages_&lt;language code&gt;.properties". To simplify the process it is helpful to copy the contents of the English
  literals file, and make translations as necessary.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, you should translate the contextual documentation (such as the document that you are viewing right now). To
  do so, create a new directory under "WEB-INF/dox/" named after the language code, and make a translated version of 
  all of the documents that are under the English ("en") directory.
</p>

<p>
  To ensure that your translation file persists across new versions of Mango, please contribute it back to Serotonin
  Software where it will be merged into the main source pool.
