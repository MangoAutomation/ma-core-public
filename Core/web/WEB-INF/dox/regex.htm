  Regular Expressions (or RegEx) are a powerful and concise way of parsing textual data. Although their definitions 
  initially appear arcane, with only a little experience a large number of text parsing problems become easily solvable. 
  Different implementation of RegEx sometime have slightly differing implementations of its functions. A tutorial on 
  the Java RegEx implementation can be found 
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/essential/regex/" target="_blank">here</a>.

  Many RegEx patterns used in Mango are similar. Typically the intension is to locate a particular value in some text. 
  As such, the pattern will consist of prefix and suffix strings that uniquely identify the value, and a group pattern 
  that extracts the value. For example, the text to parse may look like this:
</p>

<pre>This is the text to parse with my value of 1234 embedded in the middle,</pre>

<p>If the desired value is the "1234", a RegEx pattern that works may be:</p>
<pre>my value of (.*?) embedded</pre>

<p>
  The important point is that the prefix (i.e. "my value of ") and the suffix (" embedded") never change between new 
  instances of the text, and that they uniquely define the location of the desired value. At the extreme, note that the 
  prefix "f " and suffix " " also work in this case, but are less like to work in larger texts, or if the text changes 
  significantly.
