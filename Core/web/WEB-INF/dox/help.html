<p>Below is a general overview of how this application works, and design concepts that users should know. Helpful 
details can be found throughout the application using contextual help, indicated by the help icon 
(<img src="images/help.png">). Click on this icon wherever it appears to get more information on the feature you are 
using.</p>

<h1>Application overview</h1>
<p>Functionality in this application is primarily accessed using the controls in the header. Depending on the 
permissions granted to your user account, you will see various icons underneath the application logo. When you hover
over these icons with your mouse, you will see an overlay message with a short description of what the icon is 
for.</p>
<p>Beside the header controls at the right-hand side of the header is the username of the user who is currently 
logged in.</p>
<p>When your application has an active alarm, you will see a flashing flag icon (<img src="images/flag_white.png"/>)
and an associated description near the center of the header area. The colour of the icon will indicate the severity
of the alarm:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li><img src="images/flag_blue.png"> Information</li>
  <li><img src="images/flag_yellow.png"> Urgent</li>
  <li><img src="images/flag_orange.png"> Critical</li>
  <li><img src="images/flag_red.png"> Life safety</li>
</ul>
<p>You can click on the icon or the description to go to the list of active alarms.</p>

<h1>Data types</h1>
<p>There are five supported data types:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Binary</b> (aka boolean) values have only two states, referred to in the system as the <b>zero</b> value
  and the <b>one</b> value. You can use a text renderer to convert the display of binary values to whatever alternate
  labels you need, such as "on/off", "high/low", "started/stopped", etc.</li>
  <li><b>Multistate</b> values have multiple distinct states. (Strictly speaking, the binary type is a special case
  of a multistate.) Values are primitively represented as integers (e.g. 0, 1, 2, 7, ...), but, like binary values, 
  you can use a text renderer to convert these values to appropriate text representations such as "on/off/disabled",
  "cool/heat/off", or anything else.</li>
  <li><b>Numeric</b> (aka analog) values are decimal values represented in the system with a floating point variable. 
  Temperature, humidity, price, and altitude are examples of numeric values. Text renderers can be used to determine
  display features like how many decimals places to display, whether to separate thousands (with commas or dots), and 
  whether a suffix should be displayed (e.g. &deg;F, kW/h, moles, etc). Range renderers can be used to convert ranges
  of numeric values into text labels.</li>
  <li><b>Alphanumeric</b> values are simply strings of characters, such as the O/S description of an SNMP source.</li>
  <li><b>Image</b> values are binary representations of image data. They are stored in files on the host file system
  (i.e. not in the database) and are cached in memory as necessary for performance purposes. Renderers can be used to
  create scaled images - such as thumbnails - for presentation.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Data sources</h1>
<p>Data sources are fundamental to the operation of this application. A <b>data source</b> is a "place" from which 
data is received. Virtually anything can be a data source, insofar as the communications protocol is supported by the
application. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you have a Modbus network accessible via RS232, RS485, TCP/IP, or UDP/IP, you can create a Modbus data 
  source that will poll the network for data on an interval you can define.</li>
  <li>If you have equipment or an application that can send data over HTTP you can start an HTTP receiver data source
  that will listen for incoming connections and route the data to the appropriate points.</li>
  <li>For hardware that supports SNMP, start an SNMP data source. Values can be polled on an interval schedule, or 
  traps can be received for report-on-exception.</li>
  <li>Data can be read and updated in a SQL data base external to the system.</li>
  <li>Data can be generated either randomly or predictively using a Virtual data source.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data values that are received or collected by a data source are stored within data points.</p>

<h1>Data points</h1>
<p>A <b>data point</b> is a collection of associated historical values. For example, a particular point might be a 
temperature reading from a room, while another point could be the humidity reading from the same room. Points can 
also be control values, such as a switch to turn a piece of equipment on or off.</p>
<p>There are many attributes that are used to control the behaviour of points. Primarily, there is the concept of a 
<b>point locator</b>. Locators are used by data source to determine how to "find" the data for the particular point.
For instance, a SQL data source has attributes including where to find the database instance; point locators for the 
data source indicate the table and field names with which to find specific values. The logical separation of data 
source and data point attributes depends on the communication protocol in question.</p>
<p>Data points attributes also determine many other aspects of the point, such as its name, how it should be logged 
(all data, changes in value only, or not at all), how long to keep logged data, how to format values for display,
and how to chart values.</p>
<p>You can also configure data points with <b>event detectors</b>, which are used to detect conditions of interest 
in the point's values (eg. value has been too high for too long, is too low, changes too often, doesn't change at 
all, etc).</p>

<h1>Monitoring</h1>
<p>Monitoring of points within the system can be done in two ways. You can use the <b>watch list</b> to dynamically
create tabular lists of points including their values, last update times, and charts of historical information (if 
the point is configured to support this). Values and charts are updated in real time without having to refresh your
browser window. Charts of multiple points can also be displayed on demand.</p>
<p>You can also create <b>graphical views</b> of points using drag and drop functionality to position graphical 
representations of points on an arbitrary background image. Animated images can be used to create highly dynamic 
visualization of system behaviour, and, like the watch lists, values are updated in real time without a browser 
refresh. These views can subsequently be marked as "public", so that they can be reused on public web sites.</p>

<h1>Control</h1>
<p>Control of external systems can also be acheived for points that can be set (aka writable or output). A 
<b>settable</b> point can be set to a user-defined value, such as a thermostat setting or equipment control switch.
Both watch lists and graphical views provide simple means by which to input a value to set. The point locator for the
settable point determines how the data source sets the value within the external equipment.</p>

<h1>Events</h1>
<p>
  An <b>event</b> is the occurance of a defined condition within the system. Both system-defined and user-defined 
  events are available. System-defined events include data source operation errors, user logins, and system 
  startup/shutdown. User-defined events include point event detectors (see "event detectors" above), and events defined
  in modules. There are also "audit events", which are raised when users make changes (additions, modifications, 
  deletions) to runtime-affecting objects including data sources, data points, point event detectors, event handlers,
  and many events defined by modules.
</p>
<p>
  Once an event has been detected, it is acted upon by handlers. An <b>event handler</b> is a user-defined behaviour
  that is to be performed upon the raising of a particular event, such as sending an email or setting the value of a 
  settable point.
</p>

<h1>Alarm sounds</h1>
<p>Mango can play sounds when alarms are active. By default, alarm sounds are played for urgent, critical, and life
safety alarms (i.e. not for information alarms), but sounds for each alarm type can be controlled individually. To 
enable particular alarm sounds, valid mp3 files must exist at the following locations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;Mango_home&gt;/web/audio/information.mp3</li>
  <li>&lt;Mango_home&gt;/web/audio/urgent.mp3</li>
  <li>&lt;Mango_home&gt;/web/audio/critical.mp3</li>
  <li>&lt;Mango_home&gt;/web/audio/lifesafety.mp3</li>
</ul>
<p>
  To disable a sound, remove the associated sound file. You may also need to clear your browser cache. A library of 
  sounds can be found in the &lt;Mango_home&gt;/web/audio/lib folder.
</p>

<h1>Graphics</h1>
<p>Mango ships with a small graphics library which can be found in the &lt;Mango Automation_home&gt;/web/graphics folder. Each
sub-folder represents an image set. The contents of the sub-folder include all of the images in the image set, as 
well as an optional properties file called <b>info.txt</b>. (Examples can be found in the graphics directories that
ship with Mango.) This property file contains name/value pairs with the following names (all of which are 
optional):</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>name</b>: The name that will be used to describe the image set in the user interface. If not provided this
  will default to the folder name.</li>
  <li><b>width</b>: The width of the images. (All images are expected to be the same size.) If not provided the width 
  of the first image will be used.</li>
  <li><b>height</b>: The height of the images. (All images are expected to be the same size.) If not provided the 
  height of the first image will be used.</li>
  <li><b>text.x</b>: The position of text relative to the left edge of the image, in pixels. If not provided this 
  defaults to 5.</li>
  <li><b>text.y</b>: The position of text relative to the top edge of the image, in pixels. If not provided this 
  defaults to 5.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Once you are using an image set in your views do not rename its folder!</b> The folder name is used internally
as the identifier of the image set.</p>
<p>Image files are sorted alphabetically by name. Names are case sensitive. Name/value pairs are separated with '='. 
Lines beginning with '#' are considered comments. 'Thumbs.db' files are ignored. Archive files (zip, gz, tar, etc)
cannot be used since the images files have to be accessible to the web server. Image sets are loaded upon system 
startup, so any changes require a restart.</p>

<h1>Remote views</h1>
<p>Public dashboard views can be accessed from other web sites by simply putting an iframe into your pages using a url like: http://www.yourdomain.com/public_view.htm?viewId=1 where viewID= the view you want to see.

<p>Absolute positioning and transparency is used to allow the display of charts and component controls without 
scrolling or HTML adjustment, but is optional. The 'viewId' parameter is the internally generated id of the view to 
be displayed, but can be substituted with the 'viewName' parameter and the view's name as the value. (However, do not
subsequently alter the name of the view without updating this reference.)</p>

<h1>Custom views</h1>
<p>
  Custom views are publically accessible views that are written by the user, using a JSP tag library to easily add
  components. For more information see the example in customViewExample.jsp.
